operator was not well-posed, and that its solver does not support this.

If you are trying solve a linear least-squares problem then you should pass
`solver=AutoLinearSolver(well_posed=False)`. By default `lineax.linear_solve`

If you *were* expecting this solver to work with this operator, then it may be because:

(a) the operator is singular, and your code has a bug; or

(b) the operator was nearly singular (i.e. it had a high condition number:
    `jnp.linalg.cond(operator.as_matrix())` is large), and the solver suffered from
    numerical instability issues; or

(c) the operator is declared to exhibit a certain property (e.g. positive definiteness)
    that is does not actually satisfy.

This means that you have a bug upstream of Lineax and should check the inputs to 
`lineax.linear_solve` for non-finite values.


--------------------
An error occurred during the runtime of your JAX program! Unfortunately you do not appear to be using `equinox.filter_jit` (perhaps you are using `jax.jit` instead?) and so further information about the error cannot be displayed. (Probably you are seeing a very large but uninformative error message right now.) Please wrap your program with `equinox.filter_jit`.
