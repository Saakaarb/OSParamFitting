Warnings

- The fixed parameter `unused_constant` defined in the XML is not used in any of the user-provided functions. Consider removing it from the XML or using it actively if it represents something meaningful.
- All trainable parameters (k1, k2, k3) have LOGSCALE set to Y in the XML. This is particularly important for k2 (range 5E3 to 5E10) and k3 (range 1E0 to 1E8), which span many orders of magnitude. If, in future experiments, a parameter covers a smaller range, consider changing LOGSCALE to N for efficiency.
- The loss returned in `_compute_loss_problem` appears to be normalized by the maximum dataset value on a per-variable basis, which SHOULD scale the loss roughly between 0 and 1 for most cases if the dataset is non-degenerate (i.e., non-zero range). If the dataset values ever contain zeros, this could result in division by zero warnings or NaNs. Adding a small constant epsilon to the denominator can improve robustness.
- All trainable and integrated variable names are pythonic. However, be aware that variable and parameter names should continue to avoid reserved words or ambiguous abbreviations in future work.
- The initial value for the integrated variable y1 is 1, and y2, y3 are 0. These seem standard for a Robertson problem, but ensure these match the intended use case/experiment.
- Population and gradient optimization parameters (e.g. NUM_PARTICLES=100, NUM_ITERS=20) are reasonable for exploratory data fitting. For larger or more complex data, consider increasing these.
- The `writeout_description` function creates a 7-column array: columns 1 for solution time, 2-4 for dataset, and 5-7 for the solution. If the dataset shape or solution does not match this expectation, errors could occur. Ensure all experiments have three observed and three modeled species.
- No check for dimensionality mismatch between solution and dataset: if the dataset does not have three columns (matching y1, y2, y3), array assignment in both `_compute_loss_problem` and `writeout_description` will trigger runtime errors.
- All code exclusively uses numpy and math, as required.
