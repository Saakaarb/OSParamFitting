Warnings

1. In the function write_problem_result, the assignment writeout_array[:,1:3]=dataset and writeout_array[:,3:5]=solution assumes that dataset and solution have at least two columns each for correct slicing. Given the XML definition, two integrable variables (x1 and x2) are expected, so this is likely valid, but if dataset or solution do not both have shape (Nts,2), this code may error. You may wish to include explicit column indexing to ensure correct matching.

2. For the trainable parameter 'mu', the parameter range is set as min=0.001 and max=100.0, and you have set LOGSCALE= Y. This is correct, since the parameter spans five orders of magnitude. However, for ease of later interpretation, you might consider tightening the range if you already know it is overbroad compared to physical/experimental expectations.

3. All variable and parameter names appear pythonic, but for maximum clarity, x1 and x2 could be renamed to something more descriptive if desirable (not required).
