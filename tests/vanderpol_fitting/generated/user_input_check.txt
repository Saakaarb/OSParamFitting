Issues

1. No code was found for the required functions user_provided_system, _compute_loss_problem, or writeout_description in the uploaded .py file. Please ensure you have provided the correct pseudocode file containing these functions for analysis.

Checked

- XML context parsed correctly, and all parameter/logical ranges/settings make sense.
- No duplicate variable names across trainable, fixed, or integrable variables in the XML context.
- The trainable variable "mu" is appropriately set to search in logscale due to its wide range (1E-1 to 1E3).
- All provided initial values for state variables are reasonable.
- Optimization and gradient settings look typical and should not cause computational issues.
